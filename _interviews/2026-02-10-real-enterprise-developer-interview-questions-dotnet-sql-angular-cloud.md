## Real Enterprise Developer Interview Questions Asked in USA, UK, Canada & Australia

These interview questions are taken from real hiring discussions with developers working on enterprise .NET, SQL Server, Angular and Cloud projects.  
This is not theory. These are real questions asked to developers handling production systems, APIs, microservices and support responsibilities.

This helps working developers understand what hiring managers actually expect in real interviews across USA, UK, Canada and Australia.

## What is team structure in enterprise application development?

Team structure is usually cross-functional. It includes product owner, architect, backend developers, frontend developers, DevOps, QA and support teams. Each module has ownership but design and security decisions follow centralized architecture standards.

---

## What are temp tables in stored procedures?

Temp tables store intermediate data during execution of complex queries. They help break large operations into steps, improve readability and allow reuse of filtered data during stored procedure execution.

---

## What is linked server?

Linked server allows one database server to connect and query another server directly. It is used for integrations, reporting and accessing data from distributed systems without moving all data physically.

---

## How do you create temp tables?

Temp tables are created like normal tables but used only during session execution. They store temporary datasets for joins, filtering and data transformation.

---

## What are table variables?

Table variables are lightweight temporary storage used inside stored procedures for small datasets and short operations. They exist only within execution scope.

---

## Difference between temp table and table variable?

Temp tables handle large data and support indexing and performance tuning. Table variables are used for smaller datasets and simple logic. Temp tables are preferred in enterprise scenarios.

---

## How many types of functions exist in SQL Server?

Scalar functions return single values. Inline table functions return datasets using one query. Multi-statement table functions return datasets using multiple logic steps.

---

## What are user-defined tables?

User-defined table types allow passing structured data as parameters to stored procedures, mainly for bulk operations and batch processing.

---

## What are user-defined functions?

Scalar functions, inline table-valued functions and multi-statement table-valued functions are commonly used based on return type and complexity.

---

## Have you used table parameters?

Yes, used for bulk inserts and batch updates where multiple records are processed in one call to improve performance.

---

## Difference between ExecuteScalar and ExecuteNonQuery in ADO.NET?

ExecuteScalar returns a single value. ExecuteNonQuery performs insert, update or delete and returns number of rows affected.

---

## Difference between overloading and overriding in C#?

Overloading is same method name with different parameters in same class. Overriding changes parent class method behavior in child class using inheritance.

---

## Difference between ref and out parameters?

Both pass variables by reference. Ref requires value initialization before passing. Out must assign value inside method before returning.

---

## What grids are used in MVC instead of ASP.NET GridView?

jQuery DataTables, Kendo Grid, Telerik Grid and Angular-based grids are used for performance and flexibility.

---

## How do you handle million records in jqGrid?

Use server-side paging. UI loads only required data per page. Backend handles filtering, sorting and pagination using optimized queries.

---

## How pagination is calculated?

Using total records, page size and page number. Backend skips required records and fetches only current page dataset.

---

## How is client-side validation done?

Using Angular forms, JavaScript validation, jQuery validation and reactive form validators before submitting data to backend.

---

## Data annotations are client-side or server-side?

Defined on server models but can work on both client and server validation layers.

---

## Alternative to data annotations in MVC?

Fluent validation, controller validation logic, service layer validation and database constraints.

---

## How Angular client-side validation works?

Reactive forms validate inputs instantly, show errors and block submission until valid.

---

## How email and mobile validation handled?

Email uses built-in Angular validator. Mobile validation uses pattern rules and length checks.

---

## Common RxJS operators used in Angular?

map, filter, switchMap, mergeMap, debounceTime, distinctUntilChanged, catchError, takeUntil.

---

## Angular version used in recent projects?

Angular 14+ and later versions for enterprise UI development.

---

## Latest Angular versions in market?

Angular 17+ and newer with performance improvements and standalone components.

---

## Explain recent microservice development and security handling?

Services built independently using .NET Core APIs, protected with authentication tokens, RBAC authorization, HTTPS, logging and monitoring.

---

## Which identity provider used?

Azure AD, Okta or enterprise SSO platforms depending on environment.

---

## How data validated before financial system integration?

Authentication validation, request validation, business rule validation and data integrity checks before processing.

---

## How APIs tested before integration?

Using Postman, Swagger and automated testing tools to validate responses and security.

---

## When JWT token is generated?

After successful authentication through identity provider and passed with every API request.

---

## Which protocol used for JWT?

OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect over HTTPS.

---

## SAML vs OAuth?

SAML used for enterprise SSO. OAuth and OpenID Connect used for modern API-based authentication.

---

## How applications hosted in Azure?

Using App Services, AKS, Functions and Azure SQL with CI/CD and monitoring.

---

## Azure storage mechanisms used?

Azure SQL, Blob Storage, File Storage, Table Storage and Data Lake based on data type.

---

## Have you used Azure SQL?

Yes, used as managed relational database for enterprise applications.

---

## What is storage account?

Azure service used for storing blobs, files, queues and tables.

---

## Where source code maintained?

GitHub, Azure Repos or enterprise Git platforms.

---

## CI/CD using Azure DevOps or GitHub?

Both used. Pipelines built for automated build and deployment.

---

## Where code builds when using GitHub and Jenkins?

Jenkins pulls code from GitHub and performs build on Jenkins servers.

---

## How JIRA and documentation maintained?

JIRA used for tracking tasks and defects. Documentation maintained in Confluence or internal repositories.

---

## How production support handled?

Using ticketing tools like ServiceNow or JIRA with monitoring dashboards and logs.

---

## Describe recent production incident resolution?

Performance issue traced to database queries. Stabilized with query optimization, indexing and later permanent architectural fix.

---

## Cloud monitoring tools used?

Azure Monitor, Application Insights, AWS CloudWatch, X-Ray and centralized logging tools.

---

## Have you used Kibana?

Yes, used with ELK stack for log visualization, troubleshooting and monitoring.
