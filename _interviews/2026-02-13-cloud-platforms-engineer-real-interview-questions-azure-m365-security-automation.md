## Real Cloud & Platforms Engineer Interview Questions Asked in Production Support Roles

These questions are taken from a real interview discussion captured during live enterprise hiring for a Cloud & Platforms Engineer role focused on Azure, Microsoft 365, automation, security, and operational troubleshooting.

This is not theoretical preparation content.  
These are practical questions asked by hiring managers while evaluating real production experience.

---

### 1. Tell me about yourself

Focus was on Azure infrastructure, high availability, disaster recovery, monitoring, and operational reliability. Experience running production systems rather than only designing architectures.

---

### 2. Why are you looking for change in your current role

Looking to move closer to platform ownership, incident handling, automation, and day-to-day operational engineering rather than advisory or architecture-only engagements.

---

### 3. What sort of automation work have you done

Automation around infrastructure deployment, monitoring alerts, compliance checks, backup validations, reporting, and operational scripting using PowerShell and Azure-native services.

---

### 4. What is your Azure experience? If deploying a VM what do you look for

Consider purpose of VM, networking, NSG rules, identity access, disk performance, monitoring, backup configuration, and compliance posture before deployment.

---

### 5. Have you deployed virtual machines in past

Worked on production VM deployments including HA setups, enterprise workloads, and integration with monitoring, networking, and backup strategies.

---

### 6. When troubleshooting doesn’t work initially, what is your next step

Check impact, isolate infrastructure layer, analyse logs and metrics, review recent changes, collaborate with teams, and complete root cause analysis after resolution.

---

### 7. How would you design pulling data securely using APIs into Azure

Use OAuth authentication, secure API gateway, Key Vault for secrets, controlled outbound connectivity, and an intermediate processing layer like Functions or Data Factory.

---

### 8. If public internet needs to connect to private Azure IP

Never expose private IP directly. Use Application Gateway, API Management, WAF, or outbound pull architecture from Azure.

---

### 9. Pulling data from Salesforce into Azure / Fabric

Use Azure Data Factory or Fabric pipelines, OAuth authentication, Key Vault, VNet-secured integration, and incremental load strategy.

---

### 10. Experience with Microsoft 365 access policies

Configured Conditional Access, MFA enforcement, device compliance using Intune, and location-based restrictions.

---

### 11. Conditional Access implementation

Policies based on identity, device compliance, location, and sign-in risk. Tested using report-only mode before enforcement.

---

### 12. Azure cost optimisation experience

Used tagging, rightsizing, storage tier optimisation, unused resource cleanup, and scheduled shutdowns for non-production workloads.

---

### 13. What is right-sizing a VM

Aligning compute resources with actual workload metrics like CPU, memory, disk IOPS, and network usage.

---

### 14. Walk me through VM resizing steps

Validate metrics → check compatibility → schedule maintenance → ensure backup → resize → verify application health → monitor post-change.

---

### 15. What parameters do you consider for right-sizing

CPU utilisation, memory pressure, disk latency and IOPS, network throughput, workload pattern, and cost impact.

---

### 16. Have you faced disk I/O bottleneck

Yes. Application slowdown even when CPU/memory were normal. Root cause was disk latency and IOPS limit. Resolved by upgrading disk tier and redistributing workloads.

---

### 17. Partial automation for compliance reporting

PowerShell automation extracting RBAC, MFA status, privileged role assignments and generating compliance exception reports.

---

### 18. Was provisioning fully automated

Semi-automated. Script executed only after approvals. Focused on consistency, security validation, and logging.

---

### 19. User provisioning script steps

Secure connection → validate user → create if required → group-based RBAC mapping → security checks → audit logging.

---

### 20. Source of truth for new user provisioning

Approved ITSM access requests or HR onboarding systems. Automation never bypassed governance workflows.

---

### 21. Experience with AI experimentation

Hands-on experimentation with AI for log summarisation, compliance report generation, and operational documentation automation.

---

## Key Skills Hiring Managers Evaluated

- Azure production operations  
- Microsoft 365 administration  
- Conditional Access & security posture  
- Automation using PowerShell  
- Incident troubleshooting  
- VM optimisation & cost control  
- API integrations  
- Compliance and governance  

This interview clearly focused on hands-on platform engineering, stability, troubleshooting, and operational ownership rather than theoretical architecture.
