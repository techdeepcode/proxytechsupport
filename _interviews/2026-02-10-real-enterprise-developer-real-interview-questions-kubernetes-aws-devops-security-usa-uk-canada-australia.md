## Real Enterprise Developer Interview Questions Asked in USA, UK, Canada & Australia

These questions are taken from a real interview discussion captured during live job support and proxy interview sessions. These are actual questions asked by hiring managers while evaluating working professionals handling production systems, Kubernetes, AWS, DevOps, and enterprise cloud environments.

This is not theory content. These are real production-focused interview discussions.

---

### How do you store Kubernetes secrets securely?

Secrets should never be stored in plain text or inside code repositories. In production, encryption at rest must be enabled, access should be controlled using RBAC, and secrets are usually stored in external secret managers and injected into applications during runtime instead of being permanently stored inside the cluster.

---

### One node is in a bad state in AKS. How do you remove it while keeping services available?

First stop scheduling new workloads on that node. Then safely move running workloads to other healthy nodes. After pods are rescheduled and services are stable, remove the node from the node pool. With replicas and autoscaling enabled, services continue without downtime.

---

### You are deploying a new system in production and something goes wrong. How do you recover?

Stop the rollout immediately. Keep traffic on the stable version. Roll back to the last working deployment instead of fixing directly in production. Restore stability first, then analyze logs and metrics to identify the issue.

---

### You are deploying a new service with default resource limits across multiple regions. How do you structure it?

Define CPU and memory limits in deployments. Keep services stateless. Use autoscaling. Deploy the same configuration across all regions. Route traffic using global DNS or load balancing. Roll out gradually region by region to reduce risk.

---

### Describe the most complex AWS infrastructure you have worked on.

A multi-account setup with separate production, non-production, and security accounts. Hub-and-spoke networking using Transit Gateway. Workloads running in private subnets. Kubernetes (EKS) for compute. IAM-based security. Centralized logging. Multi-AZ databases. CI/CD pipelines with rollback strategy.

---

### Explain in your own words how you implemented that infrastructure.

Created isolated AWS accounts. Designed VPC networking across availability zones. Deployed workloads on Kubernetes with autoscaling. Used IAM roles instead of static credentials. Centralized monitoring and logs. Managed deployments using pipelines. Recovery handled automatically using load balancers, Kubernetes rescheduling, and failover strategies.

---

### From a security point of view, what is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?

HTTP sends data in plain text. HTTPS encrypts communication, verifies the server identity, and prevents data interception and tampering. Production systems must always use HTTPS.

---

### How does HTTPS encryption work?

The client connects and verifies the server certificate. A secure session key is generated, and all communication after that is encrypted. Even if traffic is intercepted, it cannot be read.

---

### Which AWS service is used to generate SSL certificates?

AWS Certificate Manager is used to create and manage SSL/TLS certificates. It integrates with load balancers, CloudFront, and API Gateway and automatically handles renewals.
