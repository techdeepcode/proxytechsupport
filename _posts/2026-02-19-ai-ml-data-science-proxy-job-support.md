This post explains how we provide proxy setup and job-support services tailored for AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science professionals.

## Who this helps

- Data Scientists preparing for interviews or contracts
- ML Engineers needing environment setup and model deployment help
- Researchers and students requiring proxy access and compute environment guidance

## Services offered

- Proxy setup and secure access: guidance on configuring corporate or research proxies, VPNs, and bypass rules for data sources while staying compliant.
- Environment and tooling: help installing Python, Conda, CUDA, PyTorch, TensorFlow, JupyterLab, and related ML tooling on Windows and Linux.
- Dataset access & ETL: assistance connecting to data sources, cleaning pipelines, and handling large datasets efficiently.
- Model development & debugging: pair-programming and troubleshooting for model training, hyperparameter tuning, and reproducible experiments.
- Deployment & MLOps basics: containerization, model serving, CI/CD, and lightweight monitoring for prototypes.
- Interview & job support: resume tuning, technical interview prep, coding tasks, system design for ML, and mock interviews.

## Why proxy-specific support matters

Many AI/ML workflows depend on external datasets, APIs, or compute resources that require special network configuration. We provide secure proxy guidance so you can access necessary resources without exposing credentials or breaking network policies.

## How to get started

If you want tailored help (hourly sessions, short-term project support, or interview coaching), reply to this post or contact us through the site. Tell us your tech stack (Python/Conda, frameworks, OS) and your goals so we can prepare a focused plan.
